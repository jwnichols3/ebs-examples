## To-Do List for EC2 Launch Script

### Refactoring

1. **Separate Concerns**: The `main()` function could be broken down into smaller functions for better readability and maintenance.
2. **Error Handling**: Add more comprehensive error handling for AWS API calls.
3. **Logging**: Improve logging to include more information on what the script is doing at various points.
4. **Configurations**: Move hard-coded values like volume sizes, instance types, etc., to a configuration file or environment variables.

### Features

1. **AMI Selection**: Currently, the script uses a hard-coded method to select the Amazon Linux AMI. Consider making it flexible for other AMIs.
2. **User Data**: Make the user data script customizable or read from a file.
3. **Key Pair Generation**: Add logic for "Create new key pair" option.
4. **Volume Attachment**: Currently, the script launches instances with volumes. An option could be added to attach volumes to existing instances.
5. **Instance Type**: Allow the user to specify the instance type.
6. **Validation**: Add more validation checks for user inputs and AWS resources.
7. **Cost Estimates**: Provide cost estimates before launching instances.

### Code Quality

1. **Comments**: Add more comments explaining the purpose and functioning of each function and major code blocks.
2. **Type Annotations**: Use Python type annotations for better code readability.
3. **Tests**: Write unit tests for major functionalities.

### Miscellaneous

1. **Documentation**: Create more comprehensive documentation, including usage examples.
2. **Multi-Threading**: Use multi-threading for better performance when dealing with multiple instances.
