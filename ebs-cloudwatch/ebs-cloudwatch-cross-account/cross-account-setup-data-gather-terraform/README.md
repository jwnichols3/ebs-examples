# Overview and Limitations

I expect Terraform has a more elegant way to deploy this. For the sake of time, I accepted the technical debt and created a TF project per account.

The folder structure is:

- main-account
- target-account-1
- target-account-2
- target-account-3
- target-account-4
- etc

## Usage

In each account, edit the `terraform.tfvars`
